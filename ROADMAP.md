# Spice Roadmap

## M0 — Product and compiler proof

- Annotation syntax and parser.
- Source scanning and declaration association.
- Typed annotation definition model.
- Source-positioned diagnostics.
- Deterministic generation contract.
- Competitive and Spring capability inventory.
- Developer interviews and ergonomics benchmarks.

## M1 — Application and module foundation

- Constructor provider graph.
- Lifecycle and shutdown.
- Application module discovery.
- API/internal boundary rules.
- Allowed dependency declarations.
- Module cycle detection.
- Module documentation generation.
- Module-focused test support.

## M2 — Web application MVP

- Controller and route annotations.
- Parameter and body binding.
- Validation.
- Standard error model.
- OpenAPI generation.
- HTTP middleware and filters.
- Health, liveness, readiness, and graceful shutdown.
- Reference modular-monolith application.

## M3 — Enterprise foundations

- Externalized configuration and profiles.
- Structured logging and OpenTelemetry.
- Security policies, OAuth2/OIDC resource server support.
- SQL, transaction management, migrations, and repository support.
- Cache abstraction.
- Scheduling and asynchronous execution.
- Typed application events and durable publication.

## M4 — Broad Spring Boot coverage

- Kafka, RabbitMQ, and additional messaging starters.
- Redis, MongoDB, Elasticsearch/OpenSearch, and selected data starters.
- gRPC, GraphQL, WebSocket, and outbound HTTP clients.
- Sessions, mail, templates, batch, test slices, and development tooling.
- Starter SDK and third-party annotation SDK.
- Language server and editor extensions.

## Release gates

A milestone does not complete because APIs exist. It completes when:

- Reference applications run.
- Integration tests exercise real behavior.
- Error messages are actionable.
- Generated code is inspectable.
- Documentation supports a new developer without tribal knowledge.
- Benchmarks show acceptable startup, build, and runtime overhead.
